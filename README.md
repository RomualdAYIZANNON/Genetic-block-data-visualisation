# Abstract
The current revolution in the world of programming offers a large number of tools for analyzing and visualizing data. As such, the extent of use of the R software is well established. The Shiny package reinforces the power of analysis that R offers by bringing a touch of interactivity. The genetic block set up in Nigeria through the partnership of the Institut National des Recherches Agricoles du Bénin (INRAB), the Société des Investissements en Agriculture Tropicale (SIAT) and PalmElit are generating more and more data whose exploitation requires the use of tools capable of automating their analysis and visualisation. It is in this context that a web application has been developed to facilitate statistical analysis and visualization of the performance of crosses being tested on the genetic block of Nigeria.  It allows researchers to quickly visualize the data collected in order to get an idea of general trends to revitalise crossing plans and initiate new varietal selection trials. This application is a decision-making tool for agricultural experiments in the field of oil palm genetic improvement.
