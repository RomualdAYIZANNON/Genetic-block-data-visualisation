# Abstract
The current revolution in the world of programming offers a large number of tools for analyzing and visualizing data. As such, the extent of use of the R software is well established. The Shiny package reinforces the power of data analysis that R offers by bringing a touch of interactivity. The genetic block set up in Nigeria through the partnership of the Institut National des Recherches Agricoles du Bénin (INRAB), the SIAT-Group and PalmElit are generating more and more data whose exploitation requires the use of tools capable of automating their analysis and visualisation. It is in this framework that a web application has been developed to facilitate statistical analysis and visualization of the performance of crosses that is being tested on the genetic block of Nigeria. It allows researchers to quickly visualize the data collected in order to get an idea of general trends to revitalise crossing plans and initiate new varietal selection trials. This application is a decision-making tool for agricultural experiments in the field of the genetic improvement of oil palm.

## Application interface description ##
The application interface is organized into four navigation panels which carries each a specific sidebar. The sidebares provide the parameters that are visualized and displayed on the main panel. The navigation through the panels done thanks to the Menubar.
The interface in available in both the Green, light and dark mode. The two latter require internet access. Since the dark mode is been done using the package shinyDarkmode. 
The four navigation panels are as follow:
